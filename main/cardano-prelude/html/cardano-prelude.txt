--   
--   It also does NOT perform GC before counting, for improved performance.

--   
--   Should these limits not be sufficient, or conversely, the memory

-- | Upper bound on the required work list size to compute closure size
--   
--   NOTE: This ignores sharing, and so provides an upper bound only.
--   
--   The size of a closure with no nested pointers can be computed without
--   any stack space.
--   
--   When we have a closure with <tt>(N + 1)</tt> nested pointers
--   
--   <pre>
--   p0 p1 .. pN
--   </pre>
--   
--   We will
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>Push <tt>pN, .., p1, p0</tt> onto the stack</li>
--   <li>Pop off <tt>p0</tt> and count its children</li>
--   <li>Pop off <tt>p1</tt> and count its children</li>
--   <li>..</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   until we have processed all children. This means that the stack space
--   required will be the maximum of
--   
--   <pre>
--   [ N + 1 -- For the initial list
--   , requiredWorkList p0 + (N + 1) - 1
--   , requiredWorkList p1 + (N + 1) - 2
--   , ..
--   , requiredWorkList pN + (N + 1) - (N + 1)
--   ]
--   </pre>
--   
--   For example, for a list, we would get that
--   
--   <pre>
--   requiredWorkList []     == 0
--   requiredWorkList (x:xs) == max [ 2
--                                  , requiredWorkList x + 1

--                                  ]
--   </pre>
--   
--   which, for a list of <tt>Int</tt> (which requires only a stack of size
--   1), equals 2 (unless the list is empty).
--   
--   Similarly, for binary trees, we get
--   
--   <pre>
--   requiredWorkList Leaf           == 0
--   requiredWorkList (Branch l x r) == max [ 3
--                                          , requiredWorkList l + 2

--   Why do both <a>readsPrec</a> and <a>readPrec</a> exist, and why does
--   GHC opt to implement <a>readPrec</a> in derived <a>Read</a> instances
--   instead of <a>readsPrec</a>? The reason is that <a>readsPrec</a> is
--   based on the <a>ReadS</a> type, and although <a>ReadS</a> is mentioned
--   in the Haskell 2010 Report, it is not a very efficient parser data
--   structure.
--   
--   <a>readPrec</a>, on the other hand, is based on a much more efficient
--   <a>ReadPrec</a> datatype (a.k.a "new-style parsers"), but its
--   definition relies on the use of the <tt>RankNTypes</tt> language
--   extension. Therefore, <a>readPrec</a> (and its cousin,
--   <a>readListPrec</a>) are marked as GHC-only. Nevertheless, it is
--   recommended to use <a>readPrec</a> instead of <a>readsPrec</a>
--   whenever possible for the efficiency improvements it brings.
--   
--   As mentioned above, derived <a>Read</a> instances in GHC will
--   implement <a>readPrec</a> instead of <a>readsPrec</a>. The default
--   implementations of <a>readsPrec</a> (and its cousin, <a>readList</a>)
--   will simply use <a>readPrec</a> under the hood. If you are writing a
--   <a>Read</a> instance by hand, it is recommended to write it like so:
--   
--   <pre>
--   instance <a>Read</a> T where
--     <a>readPrec</a>     = ...
--     <a>readListPrec</a> = <a>readListPrecDefault</a>

--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>The result of <a>show</a> is a syntactically correct Haskell
--   expression containing only constants, given the fixity declarations in
--   force at the point where the type is declared. It contains only the
--   constructor names defined in the data type, parentheses, and spaces.
--   When labelled constructor fields are used, braces, commas, field
--   names, and equal signs are also used.</li>
--   <li>If the constructor is defined to be an infix operator, then
--   <a>showsPrec</a> will produce infix applications of the
--   constructor.</li>
--   <li>the representation will be enclosed in parentheses if the
--   precedence of the top-level constructor in <tt>x</tt> is less than
--   <tt>d</tt> (associativity is ignored). Thus, if <tt>d</tt> is
--   <tt>0</tt> then the result is never surrounded in parentheses; if
--   <tt>d</tt> is <tt>11</tt> it is always surrounded in parentheses,
--   unless it is an atomic expression.</li>
--   <li>If the constructor is defined using record syntax, then
--   <a>show</a> will produce the record-syntax form, with the fields given
--   in the same order as the original declaration.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   For example, given the declarations
--   
--   <pre>
--   infixr 5 :^:

--   
--   A minimal complete definition must include implementations of

--   
--   Further, any definition must satisfy the following:

--   </ul>
--

--   
--   it follows from the above that

foldMap :: (Foldable t, Monoid m) => (a -> m) -> t a -> m

-- | Right-associative fold of a structure.
--   
--   In the case of lists, <a>foldr</a>, when applied to a binary operator,
--   a starting value (typically the right-identity of the operator), and a
--   list, reduces the list using the binary operator, from right to left:
--   
--   <pre>
--   foldr f z [x1, x2, ..., xn] == x1 `f` (x2 `f` ... (xn `f` z)...)
--   </pre>
--   
--   Note that, since the head of the resulting expression is produced by
--   an application of the operator to the first element of the list,
--   <a>foldr</a> can produce a terminating expression from an infinite
--   list.
--   
--   For a general <a>Foldable</a> structure this should be semantically
--   identical to,
--   
--   <pre>
--   foldr f z = <a>foldr</a> f z . <a>toList</a>
--   </pre>

-- | Right-associative fold of a structure, but with strict application of

foldr' :: Foldable t => (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b

-- | Left-associative fold of a structure.
--   
--   In the case of lists, <a>foldl</a>, when applied to a binary operator,
--   a starting value (typically the left-identity of the operator), and a
--   list, reduces the list using the binary operator, from left to right:
--   
--   <pre>
--   foldl f z [x1, x2, ..., xn] == (...((z `f` x1) `f` x2) `f`...) `f` xn
--   </pre>
--   
--   Note that to produce the outermost application of the operator the
--   entire input list must be traversed. This means that <a>foldl'</a>
--   will diverge if given an infinite list.
--   
--   Also note that if you want an efficient left-fold, you probably want
--   to use <a>foldl'</a> instead of <a>foldl</a>. The reason for this is
--   that latter does not force the "inner" results (e.g. <tt>z `f` x1</tt>
--   in the above example) before applying them to the operator (e.g. to
--   <tt>(`f` x2)</tt>). This results in a thunk chain &lt;math&gt;
--   elements long, which then must be evaluated from the outside-in.
--   
--   For a general <a>Foldable</a> structure this should be semantically
--   identical to,
--   
--   <pre>
--   foldl f z = <a>foldl</a> f z . <a>toList</a>

foldl :: Foldable t => (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b

-- | Left-associative fold of a structure but with strict application of

--   This ensures that each step of the fold is forced to weak head normal

--   a finite list to a single, monolithic result (e.g. <a>length</a>).

--   For a general <a>Foldable</a> structure this should be semantically

--   <pre>
--   t :: (Applicative f, Applicative g) =&gt; f a -&gt; g a

--   </pre>
--   
--   (The naturality law is implied by parametricity and thus so is the

--   
--   This is suitable even for abstract types, as the laws for

--   A value of type <tt><a>FunPtr</a> a</tt> may be a pointer to a foreign

-- | The <a>Either</a> type represents values with two possibilities: a
--   value of type <tt><a>Either</a> a b</tt> is either <tt><a>Left</a>
--   a</tt> or <tt><a>Right</a> b</tt>.
--   
--   The <a>Either</a> type is sometimes used to represent a value which is
--   either correct or an error; by convention, the <a>Left</a> constructor
--   is used to hold an error value and the <a>Right</a> constructor is
--   used to hold a correct value (mnemonic: "right" also means "correct").
--   
--   <h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
--   
--   The type <tt><a>Either</a> <a>String</a> <a>Int</a></tt> is the type
--   of values which can be either a <a>String</a> or an <a>Int</a>. The
--   <a>Left</a> constructor can be used only on <a>String</a>s, and the
--   <a>Right</a> constructor can be used only on <a>Int</a>s:
--   
--   <pre>
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; let s = Left "foo" :: Either String Int
--   
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; s
--   Left "foo"
--   
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; let n = Right 3 :: Either String Int

--   &gt;&gt;&gt; :type s
--   s :: Either String Int
--   
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; :type n
--   n :: Either String Int
--   </pre>
--   
--   The <a>fmap</a> from our <a>Functor</a> instance will ignore
--   <a>Left</a> values, but will apply the supplied function to values
--   contained in a <a>Right</a>:
--   
--   <pre>
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; let s = Left "foo" :: Either String Int
--   
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; let n = Right 3 :: Either String Int
--   
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; fmap (*2) s
--   Left "foo"
--   
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; fmap (*2) n
--   Right 6
--   </pre>
--   
--   The <a>Monad</a> instance for <a>Either</a> allows us to chain
--   together multiple actions which may fail, and fail overall if any of
--   the individual steps failed. First we'll write a function that can
--   either parse an <a>Int</a> from a <a>Char</a>, or fail.
--   
--   <pre>
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; import Data.Char ( digitToInt, isDigit )
--   
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; :{
--       let parseEither :: Char -&gt; Either String Int
--           parseEither c
--             | isDigit c = Right (digitToInt c)
--             | otherwise = Left "parse error"
--   
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; :}
--   </pre>
--   
--   The following should work, since both <tt>'1'</tt> and <tt>'2'</tt>
--   can be parsed as <a>Int</a>s.
--   
--   <pre>
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; :{
--       let parseMultiple :: Either String Int
--           parseMultiple = do
--             x &lt;- parseEither '1'
--             y &lt;- parseEither '2'
--             return (x + y)

--   &gt;&gt;&gt; :}
--   </pre>
--   
--   <pre>
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; parseMultiple
--   Right 3
--   </pre>
--   
--   But the following should fail overall, since the first operation where
--   we attempt to parse <tt>'m'</tt> as an <a>Int</a> will fail:
--   
--   <pre>
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; :{

-- | <tt>Coercible</tt> is a two-parameter class that has instances for
--   types <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> if the compiler can infer that they
--   have the same representation. This class does not have regular
--   instances; instead they are created on-the-fly during type-checking.
--   Trying to manually declare an instance of <tt>Coercible</tt> is an
--   error.
--   
--   Nevertheless one can pretend that the following three kinds of
--   instances exist. First, as a trivial base-case:
--   
--   <pre>
--   instance Coercible a a
--   </pre>
--   
--   Furthermore, for every type constructor there is an instance that
--   allows to coerce under the type constructor. For example, let
--   <tt>D</tt> be a prototypical type constructor (<tt>data</tt> or
--   <tt>newtype</tt>) with three type arguments, which have roles
--   <tt>nominal</tt>, <tt>representational</tt> resp. <tt>phantom</tt>.
--   Then there is an instance of the form
--   
--   <pre>
--   instance Coercible b b' =&gt; Coercible (D a b c) (D a b' c')
--   </pre>
--   
--   Note that the <tt>nominal</tt> type arguments are equal, the
--   <tt>representational</tt> type arguments can differ, but need to have
--   a <tt>Coercible</tt> instance themself, and the <tt>phantom</tt> type
--   arguments can be changed arbitrarily.
--   
--   The third kind of instance exists for every <tt>newtype NT = MkNT
--   T</tt> and comes in two variants, namely
--   
--   <pre>
--   instance Coercible a T =&gt; Coercible a NT
--   </pre>
--   
--   <pre>
--   instance Coercible T b =&gt; Coercible NT b
--   </pre>
--   
--   This instance is only usable if the constructor <tt>MkNT</tt> is in
--   scope.
--   
--   If, as a library author of a type constructor like <tt>Set a</tt>, you
--   want to prevent a user of your module to write <tt>coerce :: Set T
--   -&gt; Set NT</tt>, you need to set the role of <tt>Set</tt>'s type
--   parameter to <tt>nominal</tt>, by writing
--   
--   <pre>
--   type role Set nominal
--   </pre>

-- | <a>CallStack</a>s are a lightweight method of obtaining a partial
--   call-stack at any point in the program.
--   
--   A function can request its call-site with the <a>HasCallStack</a>
--   constraint. For example, we can define
--   
--   <pre>
--   putStrLnWithCallStack :: HasCallStack =&gt; String -&gt; IO ()
--   </pre>
--   
--   as a variant of <tt>putStrLn</tt> that will get its call-site and
--   print it, along with the string given as argument. We can access the
--   call-stack inside <tt>putStrLnWithCallStack</tt> with
--   <a>callStack</a>.
--   
--   <pre>
--   putStrLnWithCallStack :: HasCallStack =&gt; String -&gt; IO ()
--   putStrLnWithCallStack msg = do
--     putStrLn msg
--     putStrLn (prettyCallStack callStack)
--   </pre>
--   
--   Thus, if we call <tt>putStrLnWithCallStack</tt> we will get a
--   formatted call-stack alongside our string.
--   
--   <pre>
--   &gt;&gt;&gt; putStrLnWithCallStack "hello"
--   hello
--   CallStack (from HasCallStack):
--     putStrLnWithCallStack, called at &lt;interactive&gt;:2:1 in interactive:Ghci1
--   </pre>
--   
--   GHC solves <a>HasCallStack</a> constraints in three steps:
--   
--   <ol>
--   <li>If there is a <a>CallStack</a> in scope -- i.e. the enclosing
--   function has a <a>HasCallStack</a> constraint -- GHC will append the
--   new call-site to the existing <a>CallStack</a>.</li>
--   <li>If there is no <a>CallStack</a> in scope -- e.g. in the GHCi
--   session above -- and the enclosing definition does not have an
--   explicit type signature, GHC will infer a <a>HasCallStack</a>
--   constraint for the enclosing definition (subject to the monomorphism
--   restriction).</li>
--   <li>If there is no <a>CallStack</a> in scope and the enclosing
--   definition has an explicit type signature, GHC will solve the
--   <a>HasCallStack</a> constraint for the singleton <a>CallStack</a>
--   containing just the current call-site.</li>
--   </ol>
--   
--   <a>CallStack</a>s do not interact with the RTS and do not require
--   compilation with <tt>-prof</tt>. On the other hand, as they are built
--   up explicitly via the <a>HasCallStack</a> constraints, they will
--   generally not contain as much information as the simulated call-stacks
--   maintained by the RTS.
--   
--   A <a>CallStack</a> is a <tt>[(String, SrcLoc)]</tt>. The
--   <tt>String</tt> is the name of function that was called, the
--   <a>SrcLoc</a> is the call-site. The list is ordered with the most
--   recently called function at the head.
--   
--   NOTE: The intrepid user may notice that <a>HasCallStack</a> is just an
--   alias for an implicit parameter <tt>?callStack :: CallStack</tt>. This
--   is an implementation detail and <b>should not</b> be considered part
--   of the <a>CallStack</a> API, we may decide to change the
--   implementation in the future.

-- | Haskell defines operations to read and write characters from and to
--   files, represented by values of type <tt>Handle</tt>. Each value of
--   this type is a <i>handle</i>: a record used by the Haskell run-time
--   system to <i>manage</i> I/O with file system objects. A handle has at
--   least the following properties:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>whether it manages input or output or both;</li>
--   <li>whether it is <i>open</i>, <i>closed</i> or
--   <i>semi-closed</i>;</li>
--   <li>whether the object is seekable;</li>
--   <li>whether buffering is disabled, or enabled on a line or block
--   basis;</li>
--   <li>a buffer (whose length may be zero).</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   Most handles will also have a current I/O position indicating where
--   the next input or output operation will occur. A handle is
--   <i>readable</i> if it manages only input or both input and output;
--   likewise, it is <i>writable</i> if it manages only output or both
--   input and output. A handle is <i>open</i> when first allocated. Once
--   it is closed it can no longer be used for either input or output,
--   though an implementation cannot re-use its storage while references
--   remain to it. Handles are in the <a>Show</a> and <a>Eq</a> classes.
--   The string produced by showing a handle is system dependent; it should
--   include enough information to identify the handle for debugging. A
--   handle is equal according to <a>==</a> only to itself; no attempt is
--   made to compare the internal state of different handles for equality.

-- | A bifunctor is a type constructor that takes two type arguments and is

forkOnWithUnmask :: Int -> ((forall a. () => IO a -> IO a) -> IO ()) -> IO ThreadId

-- | Like <a>forkIO</a>, but the child thread is passed a function that can
--   be used to unmask asynchronous exceptions. This function is typically
--   used in the following way
--   
--   <pre>
--   ... mask_ $ forkIOWithUnmask $ \unmask -&gt;
--                  catch (unmask ...) handler
--   </pre>
--   
--   so that the exception handler in the child thread is established with
--   asynchronous exceptions masked, meanwhile the main body of the child
--   thread is executed in the unmasked state.
--   
--   Note that the unmask function passed to the child thread should only
--   be used in that thread; the behaviour is undefined if it is invoked in
--   a different thread.
forkIOWithUnmask :: ((forall a. () => IO a -> IO a) -> IO ()) -> IO ThreadId

-- | Like <a>forkIO</a>, but lets you specify on which capability the
--   thread should run. Unlike a <a>forkIO</a> thread, a thread created by
--   <a>forkOn</a> will stay on the same capability for its entire lifetime
--   (<a>forkIO</a> threads can migrate between capabilities according to
--   the scheduling policy). <a>forkOn</a> is useful for overriding the
--   scheduling policy when you know in advance how best to distribute the
--   threads.
--   
--   The <a>Int</a> argument specifies a <i>capability number</i> (see
--   <a>getNumCapabilities</a>). Typically capabilities correspond to
--   physical processors, but the exact behaviour is
--   implementation-dependent. The value passed to <a>forkOn</a> is
--   interpreted modulo the total number of capabilities as returned by
--   <a>getNumCapabilities</a>.
--   
--   GHC note: the number of capabilities is specified by the <tt>+RTS
--   -N</tt> option when the program is started. Capabilities can be fixed
--   to actual processor cores with <tt>+RTS -qa</tt> if the underlying
--   operating system supports that, although in practice this is usually
--   unnecessary (and may actually degrade performance in some cases -
--   experimentation is recommended).
forkOn :: Int -> IO () -> IO ThreadId

-- | Like <a>forkIO</a>, this sparks off a new thread to run the <a>IO</a>
--   computation passed as the first argument, and returns the
--   <a>ThreadId</a> of the newly created thread.
--   
--   However, <a>forkOS</a> creates a <i>bound</i> thread, which is
--   necessary if you need to call foreign (non-Haskell) libraries that
--   make use of thread-local state, such as OpenGL (see
--   <a>Control.Concurrent#boundthreads</a>).
--   
--   Using <a>forkOS</a> instead of <a>forkIO</a> makes no difference at
--   all to the scheduling behaviour of the Haskell runtime system. It is a
--   common misconception that you need to use <a>forkOS</a> instead of
--   <a>forkIO</a> to avoid blocking all the Haskell threads when making a
--   foreign call; this isn't the case. To allow foreign calls to be made
--   without blocking all the Haskell threads (with GHC), it is only
--   necessary to use the <tt>-threaded</tt> option when linking your
--   program, and to make sure the foreign import is not marked
--   <tt>unsafe</tt>.
forkOS :: IO () -> IO ThreadId

-- | Creates a new thread to run the <a>IO</a> computation passed as the
--   first argument, and returns the <a>ThreadId</a> of the newly created
--   thread.
--   
--   The new thread will be a lightweight, <i>unbound</i> thread. Foreign
--   calls made by this thread are not guaranteed to be made by any
--   particular OS thread; if you need foreign calls to be made by a
--   particular OS thread, then use <a>forkOS</a> instead.
--   
--   The new thread inherits the <i>masked</i> state of the parent (see
--   <a>mask</a>).
--   
--   The newly created thread has an exception handler that discards the
--   exceptions <a>BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar</a>,
--   <a>BlockedIndefinitelyOnSTM</a>, and <a>ThreadKilled</a>, and passes
--   all other exceptions to the uncaught exception handler.
forkIO :: IO () -> IO ThreadId

-- | A <a>ThreadId</a> is an abstract type representing a handle to a
--   thread. <a>ThreadId</a> is an instance of <a>Eq</a>, <a>Ord</a> and
--   <a>Show</a>, where the <a>Ord</a> instance implements an arbitrary
--   total ordering over <a>ThreadId</a>s. The <a>Show</a> instance lets
--   you convert an arbitrary-valued <a>ThreadId</a> to string form;
--   showing a <a>ThreadId</a> value is occasionally useful when debugging
--   or diagnosing the behaviour of a concurrent program.
--   
--   <i>Note</i>: in GHC, if you have a <a>ThreadId</a>, you essentially
--   have a pointer to the thread itself. This means the thread itself
--   can't be garbage collected until you drop the <a>ThreadId</a>. This

--   temporarily. <tt>runInBoundThread</tt> doesn't finish until the

--   
--   You can wrap a series of foreign function calls that rely on
--   thread-local state with <tt>runInBoundThread</tt> so that you can use
--   them without knowing whether the current thread is <i>bound</i>.
runInBoundThread :: IO a -> IO a

-- | Returns <a>True</a> if the calling thread is <i>bound</i>, that is, if
--   it is safe to use foreign libraries that rely on thread-local state
--   from the calling thread.
isCurrentThreadBound :: IO Bool

-- | Like <a>forkIOWithUnmask</a>, but the child thread is a bound thread,

forkOSWithUnmask :: ((forall a. () => IO a -> IO a) -> IO ()) -> IO ThreadId

-- | Fork a thread and call the supplied function when the thread is about

--   
--   This function is useful for informing the parent when a child

forkFinally :: IO a -> (Either SomeException a -> IO ()) -> IO ThreadId

-- | <a>True</a> if bound threads are supported. If

-- | Write an entire list of items to a <a>Chan</a>.

getChanContents :: Chan a -> IO [a]

-- | Duplicate a <a>Chan</a>: the duplicate channel begins empty, but data
--   written to either channel from then on will be available from both.
--   Hence this creates a kind of broadcast channel, where data written by

--   
--   (Note that a duplicated channel is not equal to its original. So:
--   <tt>fmap (c /=) $ dupChan c</tt> returns <tt>True</tt> for all
--   <tt>c</tt>.)
dupChan :: Chan a -> IO (Chan a)

-- | Read the next value from the <a>Chan</a>. Blocks when the channel is
--   empty. Since the read end of a channel is an <a>MVar</a>, this

-- | Monads in which <a>IO</a> computations may be embedded. Any monad

class Monad m => MonadIO (m :: Type -> Type)

-- | Lift a computation from the <a>IO</a> monad.
liftIO :: MonadIO m => IO a -> m a

-- | Computation <a>getArgs</a> returns a list of the program's command

getArgs :: IO [String]

-- | The computation <a>exitSuccess</a> is equivalent to <a>exitWith</a>
--   <a>ExitSuccess</a>, It terminates the program successfully.
exitSuccess :: IO a

-- | The computation <a>exitFailure</a> is equivalent to <a>exitWith</a>
--   <tt>(</tt><a>ExitFailure</a> <i>exitfail</i><tt>)</tt>, where
--   <i>exitfail</i> is implementation-dependent.
exitFailure :: IO a

-- | Computation <a>exitWith</a> <tt>code</tt> throws <a>ExitCode</a>
--   <tt>code</tt>. Normally this terminates the program, returning
--   <tt>code</tt> to the program's caller.
--   
--   On program termination, the standard <a>Handle</a>s <a>stdout</a> and
--   <a>stderr</a> are flushed automatically; any other buffered
--   <a>Handle</a>s need to be flushed manually, otherwise the buffered
--   data will be discarded.
--   
--   A program that fails in any other way is treated as if it had called
--   <a>exitFailure</a>. A program that terminates successfully without
--   calling <a>exitWith</a> explicitly is treated as if it had called
--   <a>exitWith</a> <a>ExitSuccess</a>.
--   
--   As an <a>ExitCode</a> is not an <a>IOError</a>, <a>exitWith</a>
--   bypasses the error handling in the <a>IO</a> monad and cannot be
--   intercepted by <a>catch</a> from the <a>Prelude</a>. However it is a
--   <a>SomeException</a>, and can be caught using the functions of
--   <a>Control.Exception</a>. This means that cleanup computations added
--   with <a>bracket</a> (from <a>Control.Exception</a>) are also executed
--   properly on <a>exitWith</a>.
--   
--   Note: in GHC, <a>exitWith</a> should be called from the main program
--   thread in order to exit the process. When called from another thread,
--   <a>exitWith</a> will throw an <tt>ExitException</tt> as normal, but
--   the exception will not cause the process itself to exit.

--   release the resource, it is a good idea to use <a>bracket</a>, because
--   <a>bracket</a> will install the necessary exception handler to release
--   the resource in the event that an exception is raised during the
--   computation. If an exception is raised, then <a>bracket</a> will
--   re-raise the exception (after performing the release).
--   
--   A common example is opening a file:
--   
--   <pre>
--   bracket
--     (openFile "filename" ReadMode)
--     (hClose)
--     (\fileHandle -&gt; do { ... })
--   </pre>
--   
--   The arguments to <a>bracket</a> are in this order so that we can
--   partially apply it, e.g.:
--   
--   <pre>
--   withFile name mode = bracket (openFile name mode) hClose
--   </pre>
bracket :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> (a -> IO c) -> IO c

-- | Like <a>finally</a>, but only performs the final action if there was
--   an exception raised by the computation.
onException :: IO a -> IO b -> IO a

-- | A variant of <a>try</a> that takes an exception predicate to select
--   which exceptions are caught (c.f. <a>catchJust</a>). If the exception
--   does not match the predicate, it is re-thrown.
tryJust :: Exception e => (e -> Maybe b) -> IO a -> IO (Either b a)

-- | Similar to <a>catch</a>, but returns an <a>Either</a> result which is
--   <tt>(<a>Right</a> a)</tt> if no exception of type <tt>e</tt> was
--   raised, or <tt>(<a>Left</a> ex)</tt> if an exception of type
--   <tt>e</tt> was raised and its value is <tt>ex</tt>. If any other type
--   of exception is raised than it will be propogated up to the next
--   enclosing exception handler.
--   
--   <pre>
--   try a = catch (Right `liftM` a) (return . Left)
--   </pre>
try :: Exception e => IO a -> IO (Either e a)

-- | This function maps one exception into another as proposed in the paper
--   "A semantics for imprecise exceptions".
mapException :: (Exception e1, Exception e2) => (e1 -> e2) -> a -> a

-- | A version of <a>catchJust</a> with the arguments swapped around (see
--   <a>handle</a>).
handleJust :: Exception e => (e -> Maybe b) -> (b -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a

-- | A version of <a>catch</a> with the arguments swapped around; useful in
--   situations where the code for the handler is shorter. For example:
--   
--   <pre>
--   do handle (\NonTermination -&gt; exitWith (ExitFailure 1)) $
--      ...
--   </pre>
handle :: Exception e => (e -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a

-- | The function <a>catchJust</a> is like <a>catch</a>, but it takes an
--   extra argument which is an <i>exception predicate</i>, a function
--   which selects which type of exceptions we're interested in.
--   
--   <pre>
--   catchJust (\e -&gt; if isDoesNotExistErrorType (ioeGetErrorType e) then Just () else Nothing)
--             (readFile f)
--             (\_ -&gt; do hPutStrLn stderr ("No such file: " ++ show f)
--                       return "")
--   </pre>
--   
--   Any other exceptions which are not matched by the predicate are
--   re-raised, and may be caught by an enclosing <a>catch</a>,
--   <a>catchJust</a>, etc.

--   <tt>m</tt> are rolled back, but changes prior to <tt>m</tt> persist.
catchSTM :: Exception e => STM a -> (e -> STM a) -> STM a

-- | A variant of <a>throw</a> that can only be used within the <a>STM</a>
--   monad.
--   
--   Throwing an exception in <tt>STM</tt> aborts the transaction and
--   propagates the exception. If the exception is caught via
--   <a>catchSTM</a>, only the changes enclosed by the catch are rolled
--   back; changes made outside of <a>catchSTM</a> persist.
--   
--   If the exception is not caught inside of the <a>STM</a>, it is
--   re-thrown by <a>atomically</a>, and the entire <a>STM</a> is rolled
--   back.
--   
--   Although <a>throwSTM</a> has a type that is an instance of the type of
--   <a>throw</a>, the two functions are subtly different:
--   
--   <pre>
--   throw e    `seq` x  ===&gt; throw e
--   throwSTM e `seq` x  ===&gt; x
--   </pre>
--   
--   The first example will cause the exception <tt>e</tt> to be raised,
--   whereas the second one won't. In fact, <a>throwSTM</a> will only cause
--   an exception to be raised when it is used within the <a>STM</a> monad.
--   The <a>throwSTM</a> variant should be used in preference to
--   <a>throw</a> to raise an exception within the <a>STM</a> monad because
--   it guarantees ordering with respect to other <a>STM</a> operations,
--   whereas <a>throw</a> does not.
throwSTM :: Exception e => e -> STM a

-- | Compose two alternative STM actions (GHC only).

--   If the first action completes without retrying then it forms the

--   then the <a>orElse</a> as a whole retries.
orElse :: STM a -> STM a -> STM a

-- | Retry execution of the current memory transaction because it has seen
--   values in <a>TVar</a>s which mean that it should not continue (e.g.
--   the <a>TVar</a>s represent a shared buffer that is now empty). The
--   implementation may block the thread until one of the <a>TVar</a>s that
--   it has read from has been updated. (GHC only)
retry :: STM a

-- | Perform a series of STM actions atomically.
--   
--   Using <a>atomically</a> inside an <a>unsafePerformIO</a> or
--   <a>unsafeInterleaveIO</a> subverts some of guarantees that STM
--   provides. It makes it possible to run a transaction inside of another
--   transaction, depending on when the thunk is evaluated. If a nested
--   transaction is attempted, an exception is thrown by the runtime. It is
--   possible to safely use <a>atomically</a> inside <a>unsafePerformIO</a>
--   or <a>unsafeInterleaveIO</a>, but the typechecker does not rule out
--   programs that may attempt nested transactions, meaning that the
--   programmer must take special care to prevent these.
--   
--   However, there are functions for creating transactional variables that
--   can always be safely called in <a>unsafePerformIO</a>. See:
--   <a>newTVarIO</a>, <a>newTChanIO</a>, <a>newBroadcastTChanIO</a>,
--   <a>newTQueueIO</a>, <a>newTBQueueIO</a>, and <a>newTMVarIO</a>.
--   
--   Using <a>unsafePerformIO</a> inside of <a>atomically</a> is also
--   dangerous but for different reasons. See <a>unsafeIOToSTM</a> for more
--   on this.
atomically :: STM a -> IO a

-- | Make a weak pointer to a <a>ThreadId</a>. It can be important to do
--   this if you want to hold a reference to a <a>ThreadId</a> while still
--   allowing the thread to receive the <tt>BlockedIndefinitely</tt> family
--   of exceptions (e.g. <a>BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar</a>). Holding a

--   <tt>BlockedIndefinitely</tt> exceptions because the reference could be
--   used as the target of <a>throwTo</a> at any time, which would unblock
--   the thread.
--   
--   Holding a <tt>Weak ThreadId</tt>, on the other hand, will not prevent
--   the thread from receiving <tt>BlockedIndefinitely</tt> exceptions. It
--   is still possible to throw an exception to a <tt>Weak ThreadId</tt>,

-- | A handle managing output to the Haskell program's standard output

stdout :: Handle

-- | Evaluate the argument to weak head normal form.
--   
--   <a>evaluate</a> is typically used to uncover any exceptions that a
--   lazy value may contain, and possibly handle them.
--   
--   <a>evaluate</a> only evaluates to <i>weak head normal form</i>. If
--   deeper evaluation is needed, the <tt>force</tt> function from
--   <tt>Control.DeepSeq</tt> may be handy:
--   
--   <pre>
--   evaluate $ force x
--   </pre>
--   
--   There is a subtle difference between <tt><a>evaluate</a> x</tt> and
--   <tt><a>return</a> <a>$!</a> x</tt>, analogous to the difference
--   between <a>throwIO</a> and <a>throw</a>. If the lazy value <tt>x</tt>
--   throws an exception, <tt><a>return</a> <a>$!</a> x</tt> will fail to
--   return an <a>IO</a> action and will throw an exception instead.
--   <tt><a>evaluate</a> x</tt>, on the other hand, always produces an
--   <a>IO</a> action; that action will throw an exception upon
--   <i>execution</i> iff <tt>x</tt> throws an exception upon
--   <i>evaluation</i>.
--   
--   The practical implication of this difference is that due to the
--   <i>imprecise exceptions</i> semantics,
--   
--   <pre>
--   (return $! error "foo") &gt;&gt; error "bar"
--   </pre>
--   
--   may throw either <tt>"foo"</tt> or <tt>"bar"</tt>, depending on the
--   optimizations performed by the compiler. On the other hand,
--   
--   <pre>
--   evaluate (error "foo") &gt;&gt; error "bar"
--   </pre>
--   
--   is guaranteed to throw <tt>"foo"</tt>.
--   
--   The rule of thumb is to use <a>evaluate</a> to force or handle
--   exceptions in lazy values. If, on the other hand, you are forcing a
--   lazy value for efficiency reasons only and do not care about
--   exceptions, you may use <tt><a>return</a> <a>$!</a> x</tt>.
evaluate :: a -> IO a

-- | Like <a>mask</a>, but the masked computation is not interruptible (see
--   <a>Control.Exception#interruptible</a>). THIS SHOULD BE USED WITH
--   GREAT CARE, because if a thread executing in
--   <a>uninterruptibleMask</a> blocks for any reason, then the thread (and
--   possibly the program, if this is the main thread) will be unresponsive
--   and unkillable. This function should only be necessary if you need to
--   mask exceptions around an interruptible operation, and you can
--   guarantee that the interruptible operation will only block for a short
--   period of time.
uninterruptibleMask :: ((forall a. () => IO a -> IO a) -> IO b) -> IO b

-- | Like <a>uninterruptibleMask</a>, but does not pass a <tt>restore</tt>
--   action to the argument.
uninterruptibleMask_ :: IO a -> IO a

-- | Executes an IO computation with asynchronous exceptions <i>masked</i>.
--   That is, any thread which attempts to raise an exception in the
--   current thread with <a>throwTo</a> will be blocked until asynchronous
--   exceptions are unmasked again.
--   
--   The argument passed to <a>mask</a> is a function that takes as its
--   argument another function, which can be used to restore the prevailing
--   masking state within the context of the masked computation. For
--   example, a common way to use <a>mask</a> is to protect the acquisition
--   of a resource:
--   
--   <pre>
--   mask $ \restore -&gt; do
--       x &lt;- acquire
--       restore (do_something_with x) `onException` release
--       release
--   </pre>
--   
--   This code guarantees that <tt>acquire</tt> is paired with
--   <tt>release</tt>, by masking asynchronous exceptions for the critical
--   parts. (Rather than write this code yourself, it would be better to
--   use <a>bracket</a> which abstracts the general pattern).
--   
--   Note that the <tt>restore</tt> action passed to the argument to
--   <a>mask</a> does not necessarily unmask asynchronous exceptions, it
--   just restores the masking state to that of the enclosing context. Thus
--   if asynchronous exceptions are already masked, <a>mask</a> cannot be
--   used to unmask exceptions again. This is so that if you call a library
--   function with exceptions masked, you can be sure that the library call
--   will not be able to unmask exceptions again. If you are writing
--   library code and need to use asynchronous exceptions, the only way is
--   to create a new thread; see <a>forkIOWithUnmask</a>.
--   
--   Asynchronous exceptions may still be received while in the masked
--   state if the masked thread <i>blocks</i> in certain ways; see
--   <a>Control.Exception#interruptible</a>.
--   
--   Threads created by <a>forkIO</a> inherit the <a>MaskingState</a> from
--   the parent; that is, to start a thread in the
--   <a>MaskedInterruptible</a> state, use <tt>mask_ $ forkIO ...</tt>.
--   This is particularly useful if you need to establish an exception
--   handler in the forked thread before any asynchronous exceptions are
--   received. To create a new thread in an unmasked state use
--   <a>forkIOWithUnmask</a>.
mask :: ((forall a. () => IO a -> IO a) -> IO b) -> IO b

--   When called outside <a>mask</a>, or inside <a>uninterruptibleMask</a>,
--   this function has no effect.
interruptible :: IO a -> IO a

-- | This is the simplest of the exception-catching functions. It takes a
--   single argument, runs it, and if an exception is raised the "handler"
--   is executed, with the value of the exception passed as an argument.
--   Otherwise, the result is returned as normal. For example:
--   
--   <pre>
--   catch (readFile f)
--         (\e -&gt; do let err = show (e :: IOException)
--                   hPutStr stderr ("Warning: Couldn't open " ++ f ++ ": " ++ err)
--                   return "")
--   </pre>
--   
--   Note that we have to give a type signature to <tt>e</tt>, or the
--   program will not typecheck as the type is ambiguous. While it is
--   possible to catch exceptions of any type, see the section "Catching
--   all exceptions" (in <a>Control.Exception</a>) for an explanation of
--   the problems with doing so.
--   
--   For catching exceptions in pure (non-<a>IO</a>) expressions, see the
--   function <a>evaluate</a>.
--   
--   Note that due to Haskell's unspecified evaluation order, an expression
--   may throw one of several possible exceptions: consider the expression
--   <tt>(error "urk") + (1 `div` 0)</tt>. Does the expression throw
--   <tt>ErrorCall "urk"</tt>, or <tt>DivideByZero</tt>?
--   
--   The answer is "it might throw either"; the choice is
--   non-deterministic. If you are catching any type of exception then you
--   might catch either. If you are calling <tt>catch</tt> with type <tt>IO
--   Int -&gt; (ArithException -&gt; IO Int) -&gt; IO Int</tt> then the
--   handler may get run with <tt>DivideByZero</tt> as an argument, or an
--   <tt>ErrorCall "urk"</tt> exception may be propogated further up. If
--   you call it again, you might get a the opposite behaviour. This is ok,
--   because <a>catch</a> is an <a>IO</a> computation.

-- | The member functions of this class facilitate writing values of

--   <tt>force x</tt> itself is demanded, so essentially it turns shallow
--   evaluation into deep evaluation.
--   
--   <a>force</a> can be conveniently used in combination with
--   <tt>ViewPatterns</tt>:
--   
--   <pre>
--   {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns, ViewPatterns #-}
--   import Control.DeepSeq
--   
--   someFun :: ComplexData -&gt; SomeResult
--   someFun (force -&gt; !arg) = {- 'arg' will be fully evaluated -}
--   </pre>
--   
--   Another useful application is to combine <a>force</a> with
--   <a>evaluate</a> in order to force deep evaluation relative to other
--   <a>IO</a> operations:
--   
--   <pre>
--   import Control.Exception (evaluate)
--   import Control.DeepSeq
--   
--   main = do
--     result &lt;- evaluate $ force $ pureComputation
--     {- 'result' will be fully evaluated at this point -}
--     return ()
--   </pre>
--   
--   Finally, here's an exception safe variant of the <tt>readFile'</tt>
--   example:
--   
--   <pre>
--   readFile' :: FilePath -&gt; IO String
--   readFile' fn = bracket (openFile fn ReadMode) hClose $ \h -&gt;
--                          evaluate . force =&lt;&lt; hGetContents h
--   </pre>
force :: NFData a => a -> a

-- | the deep analogue of <a>$!</a>. In the expression <tt>f $!! x</tt>,
--   <tt>x</tt> is fully evaluated before the function <tt>f</tt> is
--   applied to it.
($!!) :: NFData a => (a -> b) -> a -> b
infixr 0 $!!

-- | <a>deepseq</a>: fully evaluates the first argument, before returning
--   the second.
--   
--   The name <a>deepseq</a> is used to illustrate the relationship to
--   <a>seq</a>: where <a>seq</a> is shallow in the sense that it only
--   evaluates the top level of its argument, <a>deepseq</a> traverses the
--   entire data structure evaluating it completely.
--   
--   <a>deepseq</a> can be useful for forcing pending exceptions,
--   eradicating space leaks, or forcing lazy I/O to happen. It is also
--   useful in conjunction with parallel Strategies (see the
--   <tt>parallel</tt> package).
--   
--   There is no guarantee about the ordering of evaluation. The
--   implementation may evaluate the components of the structure in any
--   order or in parallel. To impose an actual order on evaluation, use
--   <tt>pseq</tt> from <a>Control.Parallel</a> in the <tt>parallel</tt>
--   package.
deepseq :: NFData a => a -> b -> b

--   
--   <h3><a>Generic</a> <a>NFData</a> deriving</h3>
--   
--   Starting with GHC 7.2, you can automatically derive instances for
--   types possessing a <a>Generic</a> instance.
--   
--   Note: <a>Generic1</a> can be auto-derived starting with GHC 7.4
--   
--   <pre>
--   {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
--   
--   import GHC.Generics (Generic, Generic1)
--   import Control.DeepSeq
--   
--   data Foo a = Foo a String
--                deriving (Eq, Generic, Generic1)
--   
--   instance NFData a =&gt; NFData (Foo a)
--   instance NFData1 Foo
--   
--   data Colour = Red | Green | Blue
--                 deriving Generic
--   
--   instance NFData Colour
--   </pre>
--   
--   Starting with GHC 7.10, the example above can be written more
--   concisely by enabling the new <tt>DeriveAnyClass</tt> extension:
--   
--   <pre>
--   {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, DeriveAnyClass #-}
--   
--   import GHC.Generics (Generic)
--   import Control.DeepSeq
--   
--   data Foo a = Foo a String
--                deriving (Eq, Generic, Generic1, NFData, NFData1)
--   
--   data Colour = Red | Green | Blue
--                 deriving (Generic, NFData)
--   </pre>
--   
--   <h3>Compatibility with previous <tt>deepseq</tt> versions</h3>
--   
--   Prior to version 1.4.0.0, the default implementation of the <a>rnf</a>
--   method was defined as
--   
--   <pre>
--   <a>rnf</a> a = <a>seq</a> a ()
--   </pre>
--   
--   However, starting with <tt>deepseq-1.4.0.0</tt>, the default
--   implementation is based on <tt>DefaultSignatures</tt> allowing for
--   more accurate auto-derived <a>NFData</a> instances. If you need the
--   previously used exact default <a>rnf</a> method implementation
--   semantics, use
--   
--   <pre>
--   instance NFData Colour where rnf x = seq x ()
--   </pre>
--   
--   or alternatively
--   
--   <pre>
--   instance NFData Colour where rnf = rwhnf
--   </pre>
--   
--   or
--   
--   <pre>

--   <tt>String</tt></tt> or <tt><a>Either</a> <tt>IOError</tt></tt>. In

writeFile :: FilePath -> Text -> IO ()

-- | Write a string the end of a file.
appendFile :: FilePath -> Text -> IO ()

-- | The <a>interact</a> function takes a function of type <tt>Text -&gt;
